> Moving to a more equal, regenerative world means breaking out of our current way of thinking. It means creating things – products, places and services – that reflect new values and shift our collective behaviours. We must allow time and permission to reframe the problem in different ways to act as a springboard for new ideas.

## Activities

- [[Synthesis Jam]] | *Bring people together and synthesise insight.*
- [[Reframing]] | *Reframe opportunities through different lenses (for example, with a different purpose or goal, or with regenerative or sustainable values).*
- [[Systems Mapping]] | Remap the system with a new goal or purpose at its heart, with new organisations in it and with different types of relationships. Ask ‘if this is the case, then what other ideas are there...?’ and ‘if this is the case, what has happened to get us here...?’ 
- [[SWOT Analysis]] | Identify specific opportunities or challenges. This might mean refining the brief to focus on one specific area or expanding it to show how everything is connected and impacts multiple groups. Hold this complexity for the moment.
