> Design is about making things. Thinking systemically can often feel overwhelming, so making things helps move you forward. It shows people what a new vision looks and feels like in a tangible way, so they can get behind it or add their ideas to it. Prototyping (or mocking up) an idea is an important way to test how it works, explore how it connects with other interventions, and see what else develops or grows from it.

## Activities

- [[Prototyping]] & [[Iteration]] | *Use prototyping to test and iterate as well as to see what else develops from the idea. Keep your mind open.*
- [[Testing]] | *Test consequences across the system/supply chains and different stakeholder groups including marginalised groups and natural habitats.*
- [[Measure what Matters]] | *Create a set of metrics (qualitative and quantitative) to determine the environmental and social impact of what youâ€™re making.*
- [[Build for Scale]] | *Think about sustainable scale. Use sustainable business models to ensure your great idea can grow without negative consequences.*
- [[Narrative]] | *Tell the story or create your narrative so that others can join in or spark their own ideas. Understand what other similar or related ideas yours can bind itself to, creating a bigger movement for change.*
