> "In dynamic systems, our work is never done. Things change and other opportunities arise. As your project comes to a close, you should reflect on it and learn from any mistakes. Your outcomes must be open-ended, focused on creating and sharing knowledge for future work. Consider what you have measured, return to your vision to determine how successful your project has been, and consider what needs to come next in the journey.
